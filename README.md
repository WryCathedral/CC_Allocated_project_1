# Sales Predictor

### Introduction:
The Sales Predictor project is an implementation of a predictive model aimed at forecasting sales for a given product or service. This documentation provides an overview of the project's process, insights, and key components.

### Project Overview:
The Sales Predictor project utilizes a Jupyter Notebook named "Sales_Predictor.ipynb" available in the GitHub repository provided. This notebook contains the code and documentation for the entire project.

### Data Preprocessing:

#### Data Collection: 
The first step in the process is to collect relevant sales data. The dataset used in this project contains historical sales data, including features such as date, product attributes, and sales figures.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset and understand its characteristics. The notebook includes visualizations and statistical summaries to identify patterns, trends, and potential outliers.

#### Data Cleaning: 
In this phase, the dataset is cleaned to handle missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistent data. Techniques such as imputation and removal of outliers are applied to ensure the data is suitable for modeling.

#### Feature Engineering:
Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into informative features that improve the performance of the predictive model.

#### Feature Selection: 
Relevant features are selected based on their correlation with the target variable (sales) and their potential impact on predictions. This step helps to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and improve model efficiency.

#### Feature Transformation: 
Certain features may require transformation to meet the assumptions of the predictive model. Common techniques include logarithmic transformations, scaling, or encoding categorical variables.

#### Model Development:
The notebook explores various machine learning models to predict sales accurately. Some of the models used in this project include:

#### Linear Regression: 
A basic model that assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.

#### Decision Tree: 
A non-linear model that splits the dataset based on different decision rules to make predictions.

#### Random Forest: 
An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting and improve prediction accuracy.

#### Model Evaluation:
To evaluate the performance of the models, the dataset is split into training and testing subsets. The models are trained on the training data and then evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) values.

#### Insights and Results:
The notebook provides insights into the sales prediction task based on the developed models. It includes visualizations and interpretations of the model's predictions, highlighting factors that significantly impact sales. The results obtained from different models are compared, and the best-performing model is identified based on evaluation metrics.

#### Conclusion:
The Sales Predictor project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast sales accurately. By leveraging data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques, the notebook provides insights and predictions that can assist in decision-making for sales forecasting tasks.
